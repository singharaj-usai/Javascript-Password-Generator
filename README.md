# Overview

âš¡ Modify an existing Javascript and add on to it in order to finish a password generator. 

## Summary

The purpose of this is to demonstrate a password generator when a user clicks on the red "Generate Password" button,
and a prompt is shown to the user to generate a password with the following:
The length of the password.
Choosing between 8 to 128 characters.
Do they want to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.
And after they have made their decisions, the password will be generated by Javascript's "Math.random() and Math.random()" functions, and finally their
generated password will be shown in the text box.

As an added bonus, there will also be a "Copy Password" button for user convenience.
